# Featured Products Limit Fix

## Issue

The featured products section on the homepage was only showing 3 products at a time, even though there were 5 featured products in the database.

## Root Cause

The `DynamicFeaturedProducts` component had a hardcoded `limit=3` parameter in its API call:

```typescript
// Before (limited to 3 products)
const response = await fetch(`/api/products?isFeatured=true&limit=3&_t=${Date.now()}`

// After (shows all featured products)
const response = await fetch(`/api/products?isFeatured=true&_t=${Date.now()}`
```

## Fix Applied

- Removed the `limit=3` parameter from the API call in `components/dynamic-featured-products.tsx`
- The component now fetches and displays ALL featured products instead of just 3
- The existing responsive grid layout already supports multiple products:
  - 1 column on mobile
  - 2 columns on small screens
  - 3 columns on large screens
  - 4 columns on extra large screens

## Verification

- Debug script confirms 5 featured products are available in database
- Featured products API endpoint returns all 5 products without limit
- Grid layout will automatically arrange products responsively

## Result

The featured products section will now display all featured products (currently 5) instead of being limited to just 3.
